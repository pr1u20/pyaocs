# PyAOCS

**PyAOCS** is a high-fidelity satellite simulation package designed for developing and testing **Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS)** algorithms. This Python package provides a realistic environment for engineers and researchers to experiment with satellite dynamics, making it a valuable tool for academic and industrial applications. PyAOCS was publicly released to support engineers in developing control algorithms and competing in the **AOCS Challenge**.

## Features

- **High-Fidelity Satellite Simulation** – Realistic modeling of satellite dynamics, including attitude and orbit control.
- **Physics-Based Environment** – Incorporates orbital mechanics, disturbances, and actuator dynamics.
- **Customizable Scenarios** – Define mission-specific parameters and environmental conditions.
- **Algorithm Development Support** – Enables testing and tuning of AOCS control strategies.
- **Competition Integration** – Used as the simulation backend for the **AOCS Challenge**.

## Installation

PyAOCS is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip:

```sh
pip install pyaocs
```

## Usage

### Importing PyAOCS

```python
import pyaocs
